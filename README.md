# register-users
 API for customer registration
 
 API that uses spring boot as a basis for creating endpoints and spring security together with jwt for their security.

 I decided to use the h2 database in memory due to lack of time to use another database, but I believe this will not be a problem.

 For the API documentation, Swagger was used.
